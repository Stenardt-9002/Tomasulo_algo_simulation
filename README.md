# Tomasulo_algo_simulation
Simulation of Tomasulo algorithm in python







Give input in textinout.txt file according to format specified in pdf file
All execution hardwares are pipeplined

if want simulation run this file
if final output only wanted run this


Enter textinout.txt enter the format given in SampleInputlist.txt





--------------------------------------------
  |    ISSUE   EXEC       |    WRITE_BACK
  |      1    |  Given    |    1
  |      1    |   IN      |    1
  |      1    |   Pdf     |    1
--------------------------------------------
Registers use F1-F16
ALL HARDWARE have 1 quantity (change it if you want to in Hardware1.py)




'busy':True,
'op':which operation
['vj':0,'vk':0] : empty means not available /if something present means the name of hardware
'qj':0,'qk':0



COMPLETE/PENDING
hardware for 2 and 1 input
Add code for line ALL HARDWARE have 1 quantity (change it if you want to in Hardware1.py)
Add instruction for issue exec writeback
Remove all hardware issue status


simulation on of status- Done
just print each reservation table only necessary stuff- Done


add renaming for WAW
iLOAD can have second register or address(number)

Show reservationstation for laod complement and store differently
